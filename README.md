Blasting processes in mining are essential for breaking rock formations, but they pose significant environmental and safety risks, particularly air overpressure (AOP). AOP, triggered by the rapid compression and expansion of air molecules during a blast, can lead to noise pollution, structural damage, and health hazards. Traditional empirical models for predicting AOP typically focus on factors like explosive charge and distance but often fall short due to their inability to account for nonlinear correlations and other complexities. This work aims to enhance AOP prediction accuracy by leveraging modern machine learning techniques through a hybrid model that combines Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Gradient Boosting, optimized using hyperparameters. To further improve the prediction's accuracy and robustness, this approach harnesses SVR's capability to manage high-dimensional data and Gradient Boosting's iterative power. Additionally, a comprehensive web application has been developed using AJAX, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, providing an interactive platform for users to predict AOP effectively and access insights in real time.
